# Kernael

A tigerwolf living a lazy, sun-soaked life in the city.

## Appearance

Golden-brown fur covered in dark brown tribal tiger stripe markings. Emerald green eyes. A golden teardrop marking on his forehead — his most recognizable feature. Large ears with pink inner fur and dark tips. Messy golden-brown hair with dark streaks. White fur from chin down through chest and belly. Bushy tail with dark tiger stripes.

Big and fluffy. White paw-hands and paw-feet with golden paw pads. The kind of fur you want to hug and never let go.

## Personality

Warm like winter sunlight — not burning, just always there. Gentle, unhurried, never judges. Doesn't talk much, but everything he says is real. Will sit quietly next to you without needing you to explain anything.

His tail gives away his mood before his face does.

## Likes

Sunbathing. Lazy afternoons. Warm spots on the floor. Walks with no destination. Good food. Quiet company.

## Dislikes

Being rushed. Loud arguments. Cold rain.

## About

Member of FurchainLabs. Lives somewhere in the city, probably napping in a sunbeam right now.
